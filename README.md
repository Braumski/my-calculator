## Calculator ðŸ§®

Just a simple calculator to get familiar with Javascript and interactive content

I learned a decent amount from this project.
 - You can get really fancy with CSS nth of child selectors (see my last selectors in css file)
 - I learned about the value tag in HTML, before I wouldve just used an ID but 'value' is more semantically correct
 - I learned a LOT about regex in this project and its amazing to make code more concise, for some reason I couldn't find out how to use regex with switch statements so I just used if/then statements. Regex is hard to read but its awesome
 - I think I got carried away on the CSS, It does look nice but I need to make these projects and move on more quickly, I always try too hard to make these look good.
